# C_Flight_Simulator
The first version of a five part project for my Software Development and Objected-Oriented Programming course. This art was writtent exclusively in C but saved as .cpp files so that it could be compiled with g++. The program takes as input two airport abbreviations and outputs the distance between the two airports. The airports that the program uses are based on the airportLL.txt and citypopulations.csv files.
